{"name":"NIST Emerging & Mobile Network Technologies projects","tagline":"EMNTG's projects description page","body":"#What is this page about?\r\n\r\nThis page presents some research artifacts that were spawn from the Secure\r\nSmargrid project with the Emering & Mobile Network Techonologies group (EMNTG)\r\nat NIST.  We believe that sharing our code on GitHub we will make it more\r\naccessible and foster more contribution.  Because the code derives from our\r\nresearch, it should be considered as experimental and sometimes incomplete.\r\nAlso, some contribution are meant to be used together.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this page is not the official page of the Emerging & Mobile\r\nNetwork Technologies group at NIST. It only presents a small subset of our\r\ngroup's contributions. People interested to find more about our group can go on\r\n[our official website](http://www.nist.gov/itl/antd/emntg/index.cfm).\r\n\r\n#Projects\r\n\r\n## IEEE 802.15.4 networks emulation\r\n\r\n### [wiredto154](https://github.com/nist-emntg/wiredto154)\r\n\r\n*A IEEE 802.15.4 PHY layer emulator over Ethernet links*\r\n\r\nTBA\r\n\r\n### [wiredto154-logger](https://github.com/nist-emntg/wiredto154-logger)\r\n\r\n*Logging tool for wiredto154 simulations*\r\n\r\n## Works related to the RedBee Econotag\r\n\r\nFor our testbed, we use the RedBee Econotag. We wrote some code in order to better manage the device.\r\n\r\n### [serialreadts](https://github.com/nist-emntg/serialreadts)\r\n\r\n*Serial port reading with timestamp information (serialreadts)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Implementation of the RPL routing protocol (RFC 6550)\r\n\r\n### [simpleRPL](https://github.com/nist-emntg/simpleRPL)\r\n\r\n*A linux-based implementation of the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)*\r\n\r\nTBA\r\n\r\n### [Routing](https://github.com/nist-emntg/Routing)\r\n\r\n*a libnl-route binding for python*\r\n\r\nTBA\r\n\r\n### [RplIcmp](https://github.com/nist-emntg/RplIcmp)\r\n\r\n*A python module for handling ICMP messaging for the RPL protocol*\r\n\r\n### [virtual-ieee802154-serial](https://github.com/nist-emntg/virtual-ieee802154-serial)\r\n\r\n*Virtual tunnel interface for the IEEE 802.15.4 serial protocol*\r\n\r\n### [linux802154-serialdev](https://github.com/nist-emntg/linux802154-serialdev)\r\n\r\n*Friendly fork of Mariano Alvira's linux serial driver firmware for the Redbee Econotag*\r\n\r\nTBA\r\n\r\n### [linux802154-regression-tests](https://github.com/nist-emntg/linux802154-regression-tests)\r\n\r\n*Regression tests for the Linux IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN stack*\r\n\r\nTBA\r\n\r\n## Contiki related code\r\n\r\n## [ecc-light-certificate](https://github.com/nist-emntg/ecc-light-certificate)\r\n\r\n*A simple ECC certificate library*\r\n\r\nTBA\r\n\r\n#License\r\n\r\nUnless explicitly stated, all the software referenced on this page follow the\r\nlicense below:\r\n\r\n<em>\r\nConditions Of Use\r\n</em>\r\n\r\n<em>\r\nThis software was developed by employees of the National Institute of\r\nStandards and Technology (NIST), and others.\r\nThis software has been contributed to the public domain.\r\nPursuant to title 15 United States Code Section 105, works of NIST\r\nemployees are not subject to copyright protection in the United States\r\nand are considered to be in the public domain.\r\nAs a result, a formal license is not needed to use this software.\r\n</em>\r\n\r\n<em>\r\nThis software is provided \"AS IS.\"\r\nNIST MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED\r\nOR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT\r\nAND DATA ACCURACY.
