<p>This page presents some research artifacts that were spawn from the Secure
Smargrid project with the Emerging &amp; Mobile Network Technologies Group (EMNTG)
at NIST. We believe that sharing our code on GitHub we will make it more
accessible and foster more contribution. Because the code derives from our
research, it should be considered as experimental and is sometimes incomplete.
Also, some contribution are meant to be used in conjunction.</p>

<p>Please note that this page is not the official page of the Emerging &amp; Mobile
Network Technologies group at NIST. It only presents a small subset of our
group's contributions and efforts. People interested to learn more about our
group can go on <a href="http://www.nist.gov/itl/antd/emntg/index.cfm">our official website</a>.</p>

</h3>

<p><em>A IEEE 802.15.4 PHY layer emulator over Ethernet links</em></p>

<p>This is an emulator for IEEE 802.15.4 networks over Ethernet links. The emulator
takes a node map as an input and computes for each packets it receives which
nodes in the simulation should actually receive it. Frame are encapsulated within UDP
messages. The emulator is optimized for speed and tries to provide real time
emulation of IEEE 802.15.4 networks.</p>

<p>The emulator currently only works with modified Contiki "native" nodes.
Connector for Linux nodes is possible but has not be written yet.</p>

</h3>

<p><em>Logging tool for wiredto154 simulations</em></p>

<p>Nodes participating in a wiredto154 can use the emulator's facility to report
logging message. The logger will read them in real time. The logger also
contains a real time viewer that indicates the status of the nodes.</p>

</h3>

<p><em>A linux-based implementation of the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)</em></p>

<p>This is an implementation of the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy
Networks. This routing protocol has been designed for low power nodes with
low memory capacity.</p>

<p>This implementation can operate across multiple interfaces (where links can be
of different type), which makes it useful for bridge-like devices.</p>

</h3>

<p><em>a libnl-route binding for python</em></p>

<p>One of the support library of simpleRPL. It is a python wrapper for the libnl
(a netlink library). It enables the python code to add and remove networks
routes, addresses, etc.</p>

<p><em>A python module for handling ICMP messaging for the RPL protocol</em></p>

<p>One of the support library for simpleRPL. It is a python wrapper for sending
and receiving ICMPv6 messages.</p>

<p><em>Virtual tunnel interface for the IEEE 802.15.4 serial protocol</em></p>

<p>Certain IEEE 802.15.4 devices, like the RedBee Econotag, present a serial-like
interface for the Linux kernel to connect to.  This software provides a virtual
serial interface, so that the Linux kernel can setup a virtual IEEE 802.15.4
device on top of it. Once set up, all the traffic that go though this interface
is encapsulated into UDP packets.</p>

</h3>

<p><em>Regression tests for the Linux IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN stack</em></p>

<p>This basic regression tests suite ensures that new patches within the Linux
kernel do not introduce regressions on basic features IEEE 802.15.4/6LoWPAN features.</p>

<p>For our testbed, we use the RedBee Econotag. We wrote some code in order to better manage the device.</p>

<a name="serialreadts" class="anchor" href="#serialreadts"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="https://github.com/nist-emntg/serialreadts">serialreadts</a>
</h3>

<p><em>Serial port reading with timestamp information (serialreadts)</em></p>

<p>When reading logs from the Econotag serial interface, it is sometimes
useful to see exactly when a message occurred. This small tool append a
timestamp at the beginning of each new lines thus making reading logs very
easy.</p>

</h3>

<p><em>Friendly fork of Mariano Alvira's linux serial driver firmware for the Redbee Econotag</em></p>

<p>A slightly modified version of the RedBee Econotag firmware that works along
a modified IEEE 802.15.4 serial driver for Linux. It activates extra feature,
such as the auto-acknowledgment.</p>
