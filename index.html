<p>This page presents some research artifacts that were spawn from the Secure
Smargrid project with the Emering &amp; Mobile Network Techonologies group (EMNTG)
at NIST.  We believe that sharing our code on GitHub we will make it more
accessible and foster more contribution.  Because the code derives from our
research, it should be considered as experimental. Also, some contribution are
meant to be used together.</p>

<p>Please note that this page is not the official page of the Emerging &amp; Mobile
Network Technologies group at NIST. It only presents a small subset of our
group's contributions. People interested to find more about our group can go on
<a href="http://www.nist.gov/itl/antd/emntg/index.cfm">our official website</a>.</p>
